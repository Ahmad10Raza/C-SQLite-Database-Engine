# C-SQLite-Database-Engine

This project is a lightweight SQL database engine developed in C, inspired by SQLite. It is designed to demonstrate proficiency in low-level programming and database management. The engine supports basic SQL operations and is capable of handling single-table databases.

## Features

- Basic SQL operations: INSERT, SELECT
- Single-table database management
- REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for interactive command execution
- Basic error handling and syntax checking

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler or any C compiler
- Basic knowledge of SQL and C programming

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ahmad10Raza/C-SQLite-Database-Engine.git
```

Developed a lightweight SQL database engine in C, inspired by SQLite, to demonstrate proficiency in low-level programming and database management.


2. Navigate to the project directory:
